Two years on, and amid a raging global pandemic and trade tensions, the Industry Transformation Map (ITM) for Sea Transport is not only still relevant in transforming the maritime industry but plays an instrumental role in helping companies navigate today’s sea of change and sail towards new harbours of opportunities.

<div class="pull-right"><img src="/images/kenneth.png" /></div>Kenneth Lim, MPA’s Chief Technology Officer and Senior Director, Innovation, Technology & Talent Development, shares the refreshed priority and initiatives under the Sea Transport ITM to support and sustain the maritime industry during these challenging times as well as for the future economy.  

2020 has sent the world into an unprecedented, and perhaps the most challenging, period in human history. The recurring mortality of COVID-19 and rising trade tensions among the superpowers have pushed the world into a deep recession. As these events unfold, they are redefining and recreating global trade, economies and everyday life, and
at times, permanently. As the backbone of international trade, the maritime industry has taken the brunt of the impact with key indicators tumbling across the board during the
onset of the pandemic, raising serious concerns on how long companies could stay afloat while operating in the red. The disruption that was abruptly thrust upon the industry had left us with only two hard choices: to wait out the storm by tightening belts and becoming
vulnerable, or to ride out the storm by radically transforming the way we work and emerging stronger.

Yet, we have reasons to be hopeful. Even though global trade has drastically contracted and would remain dampened for a while, the maritime industry continues to possess certain resilience as sea logistics remains the most viable channel for fulfilling import demands around the world, even during bad times. It is encouraging that Singapore
continues to be ranked as the world’s most important shipping hub on the Xinhua-Baltic International Shipping Centre Development (ISCD) Index for the seventh consecutive year. As an independent ranking of the performance of the world’s largest cities that offer port and shipping business services, the ISCD Index’s endorsement of our geographical
advantage, integrated shipping industry ecosystem and supportive government policies underscores Singapore’s strength, sustainability and standing as a maritime nation.

Our original vision of a new world that holds the promises and opportunities of a highly efficient, connected and digitalised maritime future is still relevant today. To reach that destination, however, we will need all hands on deck and a map to navigate uncharted waters as we steer the large vessel of Singapore’s maritime industry towards it.

The [Sea Transport ITM](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/web/portal/home/maritime-singapore/industrytransformation) is that map – a blueprint for the structured transformation of Singapore’s maritime industry through a whole-of-industry digitalisation and a workforce that possesses the necessary mindset and skillsets to support the transformation. While the long-term outlook and four thrusts of Productivity, Innovation, Jobs & Skills and Internationalisation have remained the same, our priorities have shifted towards  supporting the more pressing and immediate needs of the industry and economy, as well as building greater resilience among the companies in the wake of the pandemic.

### PRODUCTIVITY
Companies are receiving more targeted support to help them stay productive and competitive, and deliver higher value-added to customers. These include the [Maritime Cluster Fund – Productivity Grant (MCF-PD)](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/web/portal/home/maritime-companies/setting-up-in-singapore/developing-manpower/maritime-cluster-fund-mcf)<sup>1</sup>, that has supported more than 50 digitalisation projects from 2013. The [Industry Digital Plan](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/web/portal/home/maritime-companies/research-development/industry-digital-plan) (IDP) was also launched last year, making it simple and easy for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to adopt digital technology.

Tian San Shipping, for instance, is one of the first to utilise the IDP grant for the adoption of the vessel management solution which allows them to have real time access to their craft positions, and also helps in crew deployment. By digitalising its core operations,
companies have gained a significant competitive edge that directly translates to more businesses and higher profitability.

### INNOVATION
There are various research and development (R&D) initiatives supported by the ITM. We have four [Maritime Centres of Excellence](https://www.maritimeinstitute.sg/Programmes-Initiatives?tabs=smicoe#tabs2) that promote longer term R&D capabilities in key areas such as the next generation ports<sup>2</sup>, maritime energy and sustainable development<sup>3</sup>, maritime safety<sup>4</sup> and maritime autonomous surface ship(e). Technology enterprises, institutes of higher learning and research institutions can access the Maritime Innovation and Technology (MINT) Fund and the Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI) Fund to develop and deepen knowledge, capabilities, innovative products and solutions for the maritime industry. There is also [PIER71](https://www.pier71.sg/), a joint collaboration with NUS Enterprise, to nurture a vibrant maritime technology start-up cluster.

While some innovations are large scale projects and require extensive investments in time, capital and labour, like PSA’s container port automation, additive manufacturing and autonomous ships, others can be quite simple and affordable. Ideas, like leveraging mobile apps or digital platforms to facilitate information exchanges with customers or
employees, can be just as effective when they are properly thought through and
implemented. 

We are actively encouraging more innovation across the industry through regular calls for Joint Industry Projects (JIP), like the recent one initiated together with the Singapore Shipping Association (SSA) to seek fresh ideas [to build a resilient and competitive maritime sector post-COVID-19](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/web/portal/home/maritime-companies/researchdevelopment/ call-for-proposals/CFP2020). The industry was invited to collaborate and develop practical solutions that would address the severe disruption caused by the pandemic to the global supply chain as well as services and operations across the maritime sector. At the close of the call, more than 30 proposals were received, reflecting the companies’ enthusiasm for collaboration and showing the potential of JIP as an effective platform to rally the collective resources and experiences of the industry.

### JOBS & SKILLS
With all the technology transformation, the maritime industry will require a workforce
equipped with advanced knowledge and skillsets to manage new business models, systems and processes. Talent who can marry digital skillsets and strong domain understanding of maritime will be highly sought after. In fact, a 2019 manpower study conducted by MPA showed a significant increase in maritime demand for ICT-related roles requiring new skills like data analytics, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. At the same time, the maritime industry will continue to need individuals with seafaring experience, commercial savviness and engineering know-how to keep ships sailing and
ports running.

The [Skills Framework for Sea Transport](https://www.skillsfuture.sg/skills-framework/sea-transport), which reflects the diverse and meaningful career pathways available in the maritime industry, was recently refreshed to keep in line
with new technological developments and changing business needs. Individual and companies can use this framework to identify useful skills for personal development as well as career progression. There are also various manpower development programmes offered by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Workforce Singapore (WSG), SkillsFuture SG (SSG) and MPA’s [Maritime Cluster Fund – Manpower](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/web/portal/home/maritime-companies/setting-up-in-singapore/developing-manpower/ maritime-cluster-fund-mcf)
to equip the workforce with valuable skills in this rapidly-evolving industry.

During the pandemic, we are pulling together resources from WSG, SSG, and partner organisations, such as Singapore Maritime Foundation, SSA, Singapore Maritime Officers’ Union, to organise virtual job fairs and career workshops and to offer attachment and training opportunities in the maritime sector. The details of these events and opportunities are posted online on [Maritime Singapore Connect](https://www.maritimesgconnect.com/), [myCareersFuture](https://www.wsg.gov.sg/SGUnitedTraineeships-Trainees.html) and MPA website.

### INTERNATIONALISATION

MPA and Enterprise Singapore are working closely to expand the overseas footprint of local maritime companies and groom them into global champions. During this pandemic period, the internationalisation efforts and momentum are maintained through new
ways of communications, like leveraging virtual platforms for webinars and video conferences with potential international partners to explore collaboration opportunities.

\
MPA will continue to support the maritime industry towards the outcomes set out in the Sea Transport ITM. For companies who are keen to explore new opportunities in digitalisation, a good place to start is the [Maritime Digitalisation Playbook](https://www.mpa.gov.sg/web/portal/home/maritime-companies/research-development/maritime-digitalisationplaybook). It provides a systematic roadmap to help companies develop a focused and effective digital plan to support their digital transformation journey.
