For PSA, the leading global port group behind the world’s busiest transhipment hub, success and innovation are closely intertwined. Constantly at the forefronts of ideation and collaborative research, PSA is seeking to strengthen its market position as well as come up with innovative breakthroughs for port operations.

Designated to operate Singapore’s next generation port at Tuas, which will be the world’s largest fully automated container terminal in a single site with a total handling capacity of up to 65 million twenty-foot equivalents units (TEUs) annually, PSA has embarked on
many innovation projects to develop automation and intelligent control systems to become more effective and efficient.

One such innovation is the automation of quay cranes for safe and efficient container operations. Instead of being confined to a cabin 17 storeys high, crane operators would be able to control the automated quay cranes (aQCs) from an off-site office. Operating the aQCs via integrated consoles, operators would be able to handle at least two cranes each, with potential upside in productivity as the technology matures.

Complementing the aQC project is the trial of two Autonomous Prime Movers (APMs)
for transporting containers within the yard. The ongoing trial of these APMs will set
the stage for PSA to apply and retrofit autonomous technologies onto its existing PM fleet for mixed-mode operations (i.e. driverless and manual driven modes) in the port’s dense traffic environment.

PSA has also partnered with the [Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI)](https://www.maritimeinstitute.sg/default.aspx) to leverage the capabilities of local research institutions to deepen maritime R&D capabilities. This led to the launch of an R&D Grant Call last year to develop novel systems and concepts for the automation of wharf-side coning and vessel-side lashing for container terminal operations. Automating such activities is a complex challenge, given the wide range of
lashing equipment and container fi ttings in the market and the highly unstructured
environment onboard the vessel. If successfully developed, this innovation could significantly improve the efficiency of such operations and enable a safer working environment.

A collaboration with the [Centre of Excellence in Modelling and Simulation for Next Generation Ports (C4NGP)](https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/c4ngp/) has enabled PSA to run simulation tests with different scenarios to identify the optimal configuration of placing transponders for the effective localisation of the Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV). This has allowed PSA to shorten the time and effort required for actual deployment vis-à- vis carrying out validations via physical trials.

Beside automation projects to improve port efficiency, PSA was able to venture into new business adjacencies – thanks to the establishment of the world’s first maritime-focused Additive Manufacturing (AM) Prototyping Facility at Pasir Panjang Terminal. Equipped with state-of-the-art 3D printing technologies, the facility will allow AM components
including large metal parts for port equipment to be produced on demand to optimise inventory holding. This will enable PSA to expand its competencies to serve the wider maritime industry, and improve its business resilience.

These developments are instrumental in honing PSA’s competitive edge as a leading global port operator, capable of providing port services and innovative cargo solutions that are smarter, safer, more efficient and sustainable.” | ![](/images/OngKimPong.png) |

In fact, the availability of funding and R&D resources has enabled PSA to accelerate its digital transformation vision. Mr Ong said that it is important to gain a first-mover advantage and a competitive edge through the continuous innovation of port services
and solutions, and offering best-in-class services to customers. Efforts include leveraging data-driven insights for informed decision-making and to improve business processes.

“Along with keeping productivity and efficiency high, PSA is also investing in and encouraging staff to upskill and reskill in preparation for a fast-changing digital future through job redesigning and cross-deployment opportunities. Employees are our most valuable asset. Building a resilient workforce is critical to overcome future challenges
and will contribute to a stronger Singapore core. R&D collaborations with our valued maritime partners are helping to strengthen and align such efforts, creating long-term benefi ts for Singapore,” Mr Ong added.
